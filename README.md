# Dev-Check-Discord-Bot
This is a discord bot I made with silly commands to troll my friends and say stuff when you type. There is some language in some of the phrases from song lyrics that have explicit language that will have to be changed if you are sensitive to the language. It has a Black Jack command, a flip-a-coin command, and a bunch of other silly things.
